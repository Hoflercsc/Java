# Java-Programs 
My name is Jonathan Hofler. These programs are Java programs. To run them you will need a Java compiler. 
This means you would have to download and install the JDK8 and use the command line to run it or
after you install JDK8 you can download and install Text Pad and press Ctrl+1 to compile and then Ctrl+2 to run.
After that the code will run in the command prompt windows.
