# Java-Programs 

My name is Jonathan Hofler. These programs are Java programs. To run them you will need a Java compiler. This means you would have to download and install the JDK8 and use the command line to run it or after you install JDK8 you can download and install Text Pad and press Ctrl+1 to compile and then Ctrl+2 to run. After that the code will run in the command prompt windows.

(VoteApp)
The VoteApp voting program is a recreation of the C++ voting program the purpose of this program is the same to determine if an individual is eligible to vote. To determine this the individual is asked a series of questions

(Vote App2)
Vote App2 is the same program as VoteApp. The only difference is that I used static strings. This saves me time so all I have the do is call a variable and the question is outputted to the user.

(Math)
This math program is similar to the voting program but ask simple math related equation questions to kids. 

(Program)
Sorry for not changing the name. However this math program called (program) is the same as the previous program but introduces math concepts to kids to test their knowledge.
